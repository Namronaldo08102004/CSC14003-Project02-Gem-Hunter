# Gem Hunter
This is a project involved solving the map by seeking all the gems. This can be reached by marking all the traps around the map, leaving the blank spots, these will be considered gems. To some extent, this game shares many things in common with Minesweeper.


## Key Aspects
- Automatic CNF generation.
- Implemented in multiple algorithms: PySat, DPLL, Brute Force, Genetic Algorithm


## Implementing Algorithms
For details on the implementation, consider reading in the [Report](DOCUMENT/Report.pdf).


## Requirements
- Python version: 3.8+
- Libraries: python-sat
```
pip install python-sat
```

## Usage
Run the game by locating the `main.py` file and run it.

```pwsh
cd SOURCE
python main.py
```
